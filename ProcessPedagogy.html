	<h1>Process Pedagogy</h1>
	<h2>Learning the Process, Letting the Rest Follow</h2>
	<p>​Process-based pedagogy, in addition to removing the stigma from failure, is shown to possess another benefit – boosting the confidence of students who have deemed themselves “not good enough” as writers. In the discourse of writing being an innate talent versus writing being a learnable skill, Nancy DeJoy’s essay in Chapter 8, “Making Matters,” favors the latter. According to DeJoy, a student “not being good enough” 	can range from several proposed reasons, such as a history of poor grades in English, being unsure of what to say, or even lack of interest in the subject matter (DeJoy, 2023). To affirm her stance that writing is a skill that can be taught, DeJoy creates a series of guided discussion questions for students to use when evaluating each other’s work, such as “what did the writers have to do to create the text?” and “what 	is the writer trying to change?” (DeJoy, 2023, p.99). In this example, students (first-year writing students, in DeJoy’s case) from a diverse set of backgrounds are given the opportunity to share their works with one another and gradually build confidence in their writing abilities while they also develop their skills as writers. What this method emphasizes is participation and contribution, rather than “consumption and 	adaptation” (p. 105). That is to say, it focuses less on students’ ability to emulate pre-existing models of academic writing, and focuses instead on their willingness to write, and as a result, willingness to learn. This method is certainly not universal, and has limitations in upper-level and graduate level writing courses, but it is highly beneficial to first-year writing students, especially those who have 	historically experienced difficulty in English courses for one reason or another.</p>
