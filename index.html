	<h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>“Creative” writing and “academic” writing have historically existed in two separate spheres in 	the realm of academia. Creative writing as we have known it since the 20th century, focuses on 	forms such as the short story, fiction, and poetry. Additionally, it is often overlooked in the utility. Nonfiction, the Teaching of Writing, and the Influence of Richard Lloyd-Jones not only challenges the utility of teaching 	academic writing but highlights the academic and pedagogical potential of creative nonfiction by invoking the work of Richard “Jix” Lloyd-Jones, the former chair of the English Department at the University of Iowa. With his emphasis on forms such as the lyric essay, memoir, journal, and experimental writing, this work explains how Richard Lloyd-Jones contributed to the establishment of the first American graduate 	degree program in nonfiction writing, and then uses testimonials from eleven instructors in various academic settings who utilize his pedagogical methodologies, as well as the results of utilizing those methods.</p>
	
	<h1>Failure Pedagogy - Writing as Evaluation</h1>
	<p>The first argument presented against the dogmatic view of academic writing is that academic writing is the best choice when evaluating student writing, because it allows instructors to create a set of objective measures for evaluation (Yancey, 2023). This idea is not disputed, but 	expanded upon – writing can be evaluated, but methods of evaluation vary by context. Jix addresses this with the following example: “The 	writer of a good technical report may not be able to produce an excellent persuasive letter to a city council” (qtd. in Yancey, 2023, p. 23). In the traditional academic setting, writing is evaluated, assigned a letter grade, and student focus is entirely directed at meeting the set criteria, rather than developing their skills as writers. This leads us to what the book highlights as the biggest constraint of this sort of 	evaluation – students learn only to fear failure, and as a result, they do not take risks that 	would allow them to improve their writing. Chapter 9 of the book is an essay titled “On Failure: Notes Toward a Pedagogy of Risk,” by Jocelyn Bartkevicius, and it includes examples of this type of evaluation that they experienced in their own experiences as a student:</p>
	<blockquote>
Some sympathetic professors graded holistically, and a writing student could earn an A for a body of sustained drafts if some of them panned out by the end of the semester. Others applied a kind of law of averages, assigning letter grades to each draft, under which system one failure could lower your overall grade point average. In one stunning instance, during the first week of a graduate writing class, the 	professor assigned a topic for our writing – something about the necessity of animals. . . and wrote a letter grade in thick sharpie at the top of the first page – in my case a C+, the lowest grade I ever received. . . (Bartkevicius, 2023, pp. 114)</blockquote>
	<p>This influenced Bartkevicius to adopt a pedagogy method that involves low-stakes Pass/Fail assignments that involve students reading an essay, writing an analysis on that essay, focusing on both the craft and their personal tastes to create an intellectual assessment of the quality of the essay that they chose (Bartkevicius, 2023). As long as such assignments are taken seriously and completed in a timely manner, students will 	earn a good letter grade – and students who earn a low letter grade are encouraged to take the assignments more seriously, all while building their skills as writers. Bartkevicius’s example is only one specific case of a sort of “failure” pedagogy that challenges traditional evaluation of writing. But by advocating for a process-based approach that removes the stigma of failure, students are encouraged to take risks, 	and can unconsciously develop their skills as writers.

	<h1>Process Pedagogy</h1>
	<p>​Process-based pedagogy, in addition to removing the stigma from failure, is shown to possess another benefit – boosting the confidence of students who have deemed themselves “not good enough” as writers. In the discourse of writing being an innate talent versus writing being a learnable skill, Nancy DeJoy’s essay in Chapter 8, “Making Matters,” favors the latter. According to DeJoy, a student “not being good enough” 	can range from several proposed reasons, such as a history of poor grades in English, being unsure of what to say, or even lack of interest in the subject matter (DeJoy, 2023). To affirm her stance that writing is a skill that can be taught, DeJoy creates a series of guided discussion questions for students to use when evaluating each other’s work, such as “what did the writers have to do to create the text?” and “what 	is the writer trying to change?” (DeJoy, 2023, p.99). In this example, students (first-year writing students, in DeJoy’s case) from a diverse set of backgrounds are given the opportunity to share their works with one another and gradually build confidence in their writing abilities while they also develop their skills as writers. What this method emphasizes is participation and contribution, rather than “consumption and 	adaptation” (p. 105). That is to say, it focuses less on students’ ability to emulate pre-existing models of academic writing, and focuses instead on their willingness to write, and as a result, willingness to learn. This method is certainly not universal, and has limitations in upper-level and graduate level writing courses, but it is highly beneficial to first-year writing students, especially those who have 	historically experienced difficulty in English courses for one reason or another.</p>

	<h1>Why Creative Nonfiction?</h1>
	<p>“Creative Nonfiction,” as it is defined within the text, is a loose term that encompasses any literary form that falls outside the realm of expository or “academic” writing. But what sets creative nonfiction apart from other forms is its focus on the writing process, rather than the finished product. The text acknowledges that in certain contexts, the product is the focus, and media outlets such as The Washington Post and The New Yorker have commonly utilized AI or other automated processes to generate written content to some extent. (Hesse and Julier, 2023). However, this has not steered human writers away from a process-centered approach, something that Hesse and Julier attribute to the resurgence in analog media, such as printed books and vinyl records (Hesse and Julier, 2023, p. 11). Rachel Faldet’s essay in chapter 9, titled “Personal Essays as a Path to Effective Transactional Writing, or No, You Haven’t Always Wanted to Be a Doctor,” demonstrates that the humanistic nature of creative nonfiction forms allows students to develop analytical skills to consider the very motivations that drive them toward their goals. The titular example used by Faldet is that of a student who had goals of becoming a physician. The personal statement written by this student used professional-sounding language and attempted to convince readers that the student possessed the necessary knowledge of what would be expected of a physician – and it is learned that this student was rejected from every medical school that they had applied to. Faldet then challenges the student to analyze their own motivations as to why they want to be a physician in the first place – and upon doing this, the student comes to the realization that their true passion is public health, prompting them to seek a degree in environmental science instead (Faldet, 2023). Most of the essays within the text advocate for a process-focused pedagogy because of its potential to reduce student inhibition to write – but Faldet’s essay provides additional potential for such a pedagogy, in the sense that the process allows students to meta-analyze their own thought processes insofar that they can discover their true passions and set goals to pursue those passions.</p>
	
	<h1>Recommendation</h1>
	<p>​I strongly recommend <cite>Nonfiction, the Teaching of Writing, and the Influence of Richard Lloyd-Jones</cite> to instructors and English students alike. Beginning with the teaching philosophy and methodologies of one of the most prominent instructors in the realm of nonfiction and how he shaped the curriculum of the University of Iowa, the book provides a brief yet comprehensive look at the evolution of creative nonfiction in 	the classroom from the 1970s onward, and how its place in academia has changed over time. The addition of essays compiled from scholars that knew Richard “Jix” Lloyd-Jones personally and others who simply studied his methods not only demonstrates how they stand the test of time, but also how the ever-evolving nuances of the modern classroom provide unique challenges that prompt instructors to develop new, creative 	ways to employ those methods. Additionally, the book highlights the benefits of process-centered pedagogy without completely dismissing the thought processes behind product-based pedagogy, placing context as the key for each approach.</p>
