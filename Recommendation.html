	<h1>Recommendation</h1>
	<p>​Beginning with the teaching philosophy and methodologies of one of the most prominent instructors in the realm of nonfiction and how he shaped the curriculum of the University of Iowa, the book provides a brief yet comprehensive look at the evolution of creative nonfiction in the classroom from the 1970s onward, and how its place in academia has changed over time. While I strongly recommend <cite>Nonfiction, the Teaching of Writing, and the Influence of Richard Lloyd-Jones</cite> to English instructors and students alike, the academic value that it offers is the most beneficial to instructors of first-year writing courses. In the discourse of writing as evaluation versus writing as an opportunity to learn from taking risks, the pedagogical methods adopted by instructors adhering to the book’s suggestions cater heavily to fledgling student writers and may not be as effective when applied toward more experienced student writers. While this admittedly limits the book’s utility, it is still an invaluable resource that provides first-year writing instructors with a set of less-than traditional methods and exercises that can help brace students for the ever-changing landscape of the modern composition classroom. Additionally, the book highlights the benefits of process-centered pedagogy without completely dismissing the thought processes behind product-based pedagogy, placing context as the key for each approach.</p>
