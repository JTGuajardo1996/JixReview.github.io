	<h1>Failure Pedagogy</h1>
	<h2>"Academic" Writing as Evaluation</h2>
	<p>The first argument presented against the dogmatic view of academic writing is that academic writing is the best choice when evaluating student writing, because it allows instructors to create a set of objective measures for evaluation (Yancey, 2023). This idea is not disputed, but 	expanded upon – writing can be evaluated, but methods of evaluation vary by context. Jix addresses this with the following example: “The 	writer of a good technical report may not be able to produce an excellent persuasive letter to a city council” (qtd. in Yancey, 2023, p. 23). In the traditional academic setting, writing is evaluated, assigned a letter grade, and student focus is entirely directed at meeting the set criteria, rather than developing their skills as writers. This leads us to what the book highlights as the biggest constraint of this sort of 	evaluation – students learn only to fear failure, and as a result, they do not take risks that 	would allow them to improve their writing. Chapter 9 of the book is an essay titled “On Failure: Notes Toward a Pedagogy of Risk,” by Jocelyn Bartkevicius, and it includes examples of this type of evaluation that they experienced in their own experiences as a student:</p>
	<blockquote>
Some sympathetic professors graded holistically, and a writing student could earn an A for a body of sustained drafts if some of them panned out by the end of the semester. Others applied a kind of law of averages, assigning letter grades to each draft, under which system one failure could lower your overall grade point average. In one stunning instance, during the first week of a graduate writing class, the 	professor assigned a topic for our writing – something about the necessity of animals. . . and wrote a letter grade in thick sharpie at the top of the first page – in my case a C+, the lowest grade I ever received. . . (Bartkevicius, 2023, pp. 114)</blockquote>
	<p>This influenced Bartkevicius to adopt a pedagogy method that involves low-stakes Pass/Fail assignments that involve students reading an essay, writing an analysis on that essay, focusing on both the craft and their personal tastes to create an intellectual assessment of the quality of the essay that they chose (Bartkevicius, 2023). As long as such assignments are taken seriously and completed in a timely manner, students will 	earn a good letter grade – and students who earn a low letter grade are encouraged to take the assignments more seriously, all while building their skills as writers. Bartkevicius’s example is only one specific case of a sort of “failure” pedagogy that challenges traditional evaluation of writing. But by advocating for a process-based approach that removes the stigma of failure, students are encouraged to take risks, 	and can unconsciously develop their skills as writers.
