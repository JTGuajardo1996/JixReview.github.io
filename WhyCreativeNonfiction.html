	<h1>Why Creative Nonfiction?</h1>
	<h2>Nonfiction as a Means to Self-discovery</h2>
	<p>“Creative Nonfiction,” as it is defined within the text, is a loose term that encompasses any literary form that falls outside the realm of expository or “academic” writing. But what sets creative nonfiction apart from other forms is its focus on the writing process, rather than the finished product. The text acknowledges that in certain contexts, the product is the focus, and media outlets such as The Washington Post and The New Yorker have commonly utilized AI or other automated processes to generate written content to some extent. (Hesse and Julier, 2023). However, this has not steered human writers away from a process-centered approach, something that Hesse and Julier attribute to the resurgence in analog media, such as printed books and vinyl records (Hesse and Julier, 2023, p. 11). Rachel Faldet’s essay in chapter 9, titled “Personal Essays as a Path to Effective Transactional Writing, or No, You Haven’t Always Wanted to Be a Doctor,” demonstrates that the humanistic nature of creative nonfiction forms allows students to develop analytical skills to consider the very motivations that drive them toward their goals. The titular example used by Faldet is that of a student who had goals of becoming a physician. The personal statement written by this student used professional-sounding language and attempted to convince readers that the student possessed the necessary knowledge of what would be expected of a physician – and it is learned that this student was rejected from every medical school that they had applied to. Faldet then challenges the student to analyze their own motivations as to why they want to be a physician in the first place – and upon doing this, the student comes to the realization that their true passion is public health, prompting them to seek a degree in environmental science instead (Faldet, 2023). Most of the essays within the text advocate for a process-focused pedagogy because of its potential to reduce student inhibition to write – but Faldet’s essay provides additional potential for such a pedagogy, in the sense that the process allows students to meta-analyze their own thought processes insofar that they can discover their true passions and set goals to pursue those passions.</p>
